<h2>Taking Care of a Hamster</h2>
<p><b>Overview:</b> Hamsters are common pets for first-time pet owners, especially children, but what many people don't realize is that hamsters require a lot more time and effort that would likely be too much for a child to handle on their own without the assistance of an adult. Hamsters are short-term responsibilities since their life spans are usually only 1-3 years, ideal for owners who can't commit to a long-term pet. Even though hamsters only live up to 3 years, it doesn't mean they should be disregarded and given less attention than an animal with a longer life span. Hamsters still require a lot of attention and daily care in order to ensure they get the best quality of life as possible.</p>

  <b>Diet &amp; Living Spaces: </b>A hamster's diet should include pellets that can be bought from pet stores, small amounts of fresh fruit such as apple, pear, and peach or vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, cucumber, and spinach. Hamsters should also be given timothy hay that's full of fiber, and fresh water at all times. Treats like nuts, mealworms, and boiled egg can be given to your hamster occasionally in very small amounts. Because hamsters require play time and are curious creatures who love to scavenge and play, hiding their food by burying it in their bedding or little cardboard tubes or boxes is a great way to entertain your hamster while also helping them get a little bit of exercise in their cage. Of course, this isn't a substitute from play time outside of the cage, but it is a great alternative to keeping your hamster entertained while inside their cage. Hamster cages should have a fresh bottle of water attached to it at all times and the water bottle should be washed and the water should be replaced once a week to ensure your hamster's water supply stays clean and fresh. Your hamster's cage should have a solid floor with lots of bedding that should be replaced every time it gets soiled or wet. The ideal cage should be large enough to have many layers with hideouts and toys and a hamster wheel to encourage physical activity and prevent your hamster from being bored.</p>

<p><img src="hamsterpic3.jpg" alt="hamster picture" style="height:250px;width:250px;margin-left:20px;"></a><b>Common Health Issues:</b> One of the most common health problems for hamsters is wet tail, which is caused from bacterial infections, stress, or dietary issues and is often the result of diarrhea, inactivity, poor appetite, and an unkempt coat. Hamsters who suffer from wet tail often die very suddenly and should be taken to the vet immediately. Hamsters should always be drinking plenty of water to avoid digestive problems and to prevent dehydration from diarrhea. Like bunnies, hamsters can also develop teeth problems if they lack lots of fiber to chew on and wear their teeth down. It is very likely that once a hamster develops dental issues, their teeth must be trimmed regularly for the rest of their lives, so providing hamsters with plenty of timothy hay to chew on is the best way to combat common hamster dental issues.
